# IDS-project

This repository contains a machine learning algorithm (using random forest and linear regression)

It's reccomended to run the .py files in pycharm, since the project interpreter is already configured and a part of the project.

RandomForestRegression has by far the best results when comparing it with linear regression

Currently the issue with this project is overfitting. All the current attempts at it are pretty much useless, that's why we produced such high and good results

Tested on AMD stocks, Microsoft stocks and Apple stocks (RandomForestRegression worked best with AMD stocks)
